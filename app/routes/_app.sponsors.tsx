Since 2018, SeaDrive and the Oseberg Viking Heritage Foundation, who built Saga Farmann, have been working in a partnership to develop and test an electrical propulsion solution. Today SeaDrive sells these POD's to a large variety of customers throughout Europe - all based on an idea for a Viking ship.",

These fundings gave us the confidence that the voyage can be done and gave us motivation to carry on the preparation for the voyage. It is obvious that without Wilhelmsen supporting us we would not have been able to leave TÃ¸nsberg - Thank you",

From the very first attempt to electrify our ship, BlueTec has helped us with cabling and electric installations on board. As a test ship for solutions under development the installations were not permanent and every year a new installation or at least an upgrade was needed. Deadlines and challenging tasks has been handled nicely by BlueTec and for that we're truly grateful - Thanks",

In the last weeks before departure we were told that in order to get our ship certified to enter EU (Germany) we needed to have all tubes from inlets under the waterline to be exchanged with steel pipes and swans neck above waterline.....Luckily Terjesen, the leading plummer in the area stepped in with short notice and fixed the plumbing. Very fast response and nice plumbing that even a viking must adore - thank you Terjesen",

With these funds we could undertake the planning of the voyage and kick of the initiatives needed to get momentum. Saga Farmann will bring our viking heritage out to people of Europe but our County definitely delivered a nice kick at the right time for us to get started - thanks",

Our RIB is used to add power to the ship when needed acting as an external engine for pushing or pulling the ship. But also the RIB is used for logistic purposes running to and from shore with crew, food or fuel. Mercury has delivered a new 50Hp outboard engine for a very reasonable price making sure that we can rely on our important RIB on this long voyage - Thank you Mercury",

With the Eltek solution we can consume both generator and shore based electricity, convert it to 48V DC and charge our batteries. But most important is that Eltek has provided us with competence, spareparts and man hours to make sure that we can charge our ship anywhere and with confidence to adjust to almost any power source we meet - well done Eltek",
